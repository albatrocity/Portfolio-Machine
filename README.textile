h2. Portfolio Machine

by "Ross Brown":http://rossisbrown.com

An undocumented CSS3-littered explosion of awesome. Portfolio Machine is a rotating shelf that displays portfolio items, allowing you to select an item for a more detailed view. It does this by harnessing the power of VHS tapes. And jQuery.

Portfolio items are generated from portfolio.js and placed in index.html with underscore.js's templating function. Paging and back button functionality made possible with sammy.js and "guitsaru":http://github.com/guitsaru.

jQuery plugins used:

* "underscore":http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
* "sammy":http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/
* "easing":http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
* "scrollfollow":http://kitchen.net-perspective.com/
* "defuscate":http://www.ia-stud.hiof.no/~joakims/projects/defuscator/

The MIT license does not cover the contents of the /images folder, or the portfolio.js file. I retain the rights to those, suckers.
